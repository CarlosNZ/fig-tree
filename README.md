# expression-evaluator

Module to evaluate JSON-structured expressions.

Documentation pending.

See [here](https://github.com/openmsupply/conforma-server/wiki/Query-Syntax) for V1 documentation.

### Quick start

`yarn setup` -- installs required dependencies for both the main module and the demo app

Run `yarn demo` to load a browser-based explorer for trying out queries. (You'll need to run `yarn install` within the "demo" folder first)
