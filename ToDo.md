- Do we need individual "Fallback" parameters?
- Codegen operator reference rather than compute each time
- String Sub -- shouldn't complain about missing prop if no substitutions in main string
- Allow type coercion with no operation (with tests)

- Tidy up API/GraphQL processing chain (helper functions)
- Logging option
